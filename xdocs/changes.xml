This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
CVS commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.


The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

    <release version="1.1-RC1" date="TBD"  
 description="This is a maintenance release containing bug fixes and enhancements.
       All API changes are binary compatible with version 1.0. The enhancements 
       include some new probability distributions, a Fraction class, new matrix
       and numerical utilities, and a PRNG pluggability framework making it
       possible to replace the JDK-supplied random number generator in
       commons-math (and elsewhere) with alternative PRNG implementations.">
	  <action dev="brentworden" type="fix" issue="36105" due-to="Mikael Weigelt">
		Changed ContinuedFraction to better handle infinite convergents that
		resulted in divergent continued fraction evaluations.
	  </action>
      <action dev="brentworden" type="fix" issue="35904"  due-to="Srinivas Vemury">
        Changed rounding methods to not rely on BigDecimal conversions which
		was causing numerical error.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="35434"  due-to="Jörg Weimar">
        Changed Fraction(double) to correctly handle near-integral arguments.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="35431"  due-to="Jörg Weimar">
        Changed lcm to throw ArithmeticException (instead of returning bogus
        value) if the result is too large to store as an integer.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="32663"  due-to="Mary Ellen Foster">

      <action dev="psteitz" type="update" issue="35007"  due-to="Rodrigo di Lorenzo Lopes">
        Added setSubMatrix methods to RealMatrixImpl, BigMatrixImpl.  To

        not added to the RealMatrix, BigMatrix interfaces.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Added createXIdentityMatrix methods to MatrixUtils and deprecated
        getIdentity methods in RealMatrixImpl, BigMatrixImpl.

        IllegalArgumentExceptions instead of ArrayIndexOutOfBounds when
        dimension arguments are not positive.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="update">
        Made PRNG pluggable for classes in the random package.  Added
        RandomGenerator interface extracted from java.util.random and abstract
        implementation, AbstractRandomGenerator providing default
        implementations of methods based on nextDouble().  Added a constructor
        taking a RandomGenerator as an argument to RandomDataImpl.  Changed
        ValueServer to use a RandomData in its constructor.  Changes to 
        1.0 classes should be backward compatible (including serialization).
